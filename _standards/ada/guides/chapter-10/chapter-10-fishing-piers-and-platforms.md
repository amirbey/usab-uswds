*\"Whenever any barrier stands between you and the full rights and
dignity of citizenship, we must work to remove it, in the name of simple
decency and justice. The promise of the ADA\...has enabled people with
disabilities to enjoy much greater access to a wide range of affordable
travel, recreational opportunities and life-enriching services.\"*

The recreation facility guidelines described in this guide focus on
newly designed or newly constructed and altered fishing piers and
platforms. Other provisions contained in ADAAG address elements commonly
found at a fishing facility, such as accessible vehicle parking spaces,
exterior accessible routes, and toilet and bathing facilities. ADAAG
addresses only the built environment (structures and grounds). The
guidelines do not address operational issues. Questions regarding
operational issues should be directed to the Department of Justice,
1-800-514-0301 or 1-800-514-0383 (TTY).

These guidelines only apply to facilities specifically designed and
constructed for fishing. Structures that were not built specifically for
fishing do not need to meet these requirements, even if people use them
for fishing (for example, a bridge, flood control dam or breakwater
jetty).

![photo of man in wheelchair fishing from floating
pier](/images/guidelines_standards/Recreation_Facilities/Recreation_Facilities/fishing-guide/p5fish.jpg){width="200"
height="200"}ADAAG requires that at least one accessible route connect
accessible buildings, facilities, elements and spaces on the site.
Accessible fishing piers and platforms and other accessible spaces and
elements within a fishing facility must also be connected by an
accessible route. The accessible route must comply with ADAAG provisions
for the location, width (minimum of 36 inches), passing space, head
room, surface, slope (maximum of 1:12 or 8.33%), changes in level,
doors, egress, and areas of rescue assistance, unless otherwise modified
by specific provisions outlined in this guide.

**Gangways**\
A gangway is a variable-sloped pedestrian walkway linking a fixed
structure or land with a floating structure. Where gangways are provided
as part of accessible routes to connect floating accessible fishing
piers or platforms, the following exceptions to ADAAG have been included
to deal with the varying water level changes and other factors in this
dynamic environment. Designers and operators should note that there are
no exceptions to the accessible route requirements where the accessible
route connects to a fixed fishing pier or platform.

**Gangway Slope and Rise Exceptions**\
Gangways must be designed to provide for a maximum 1:12 (8.33%) slope
but are not required to be longer than 30 feet in length. There is no
maximum slope requirement for gangways 30 feet or longer. For example,
where the vertical distance between where the gangway departs the
landside connection and the elevation of the pier surface at the lowest
water level is 4 feet, the gangway would have to be at least 30 feet
long. As water levels rise and fall, gangway slopes also rise and fall.
At times, this gangway slope may be less than 1:20 (5%) and at other
times it may be more than 1:12 (8.33%). Designers are encouraged to
provide the least possible gangway slope, where possible, to give
independent access to persons with disabilities.

![illustration of accessible gangway serving accessible floating pier in
a large
facility](/images/guidelines_standards/Recreation_Facilities/Recreation_Facilities/fishing-guide/page-6.jpg)

The maximum rise requirements in ADAAG do not apply to gangways. As a
result, no intermediate landings on the gangways are required and
gangways may be any length.

The gangway slope and rise exceptions do not apply to other sloped
walking surfaces that may be part of the accessible route. For example,
where a non-gangway sloped walking surface greater than 1:20 (5%) is
provided as part of an accessible route connecting accessible elements
at a fishing facility, it must comply with ADAAG slope and rise
requirements. This would include a ramp connecting a fixed pier or a
float with fixed switchback ramps.

**Gangway Alterations**\
Gangways on existing fishing facilities may be repaired or replaced
without triggering the requirement to increase the gangway length.
However, if the areas altered contain primary functions (such as a
fishing station), existing gangways are considered part of the path of
travel to the altered primary function areas and must be made
accessible, if the cost to do so is not disproportionate. The Department
of Justice has determined that it is not disproportionate to spend up to
an additional 20 percent of the overall costs of alterations to the
primary function area to make the path of travel accessible.

**Transition Plates ** Transition plates are sloping pedestrian walking
surfaces located at the end of a gangway. Gangways are not required to
have landings at the end, if transition plates are provided. If the
slope of the transition plate is greater than 1:20 (5%), transition
plates must have a landing at the end of the transition plate not
connected to the gangway and comply with other ADAAG ramp requirements.

**Handrail Extensions**\
ADAAG addresses handrail height, diameter, and extensions provided to
the end of the gangway. Other specifications regarding vertical supports
may be addressed in other building codes. Handrail extensions are not
required where gangways and transition plates connect and both are
provided with handrails. ADAAG does not require handrails on sloped
surfaces that have a rise of less than 6 inches or a projection less
than 72 inches, or a slope of 1:20 (5%) or less. If handrail extensions
are provided, they do not need to be parallel with the ground or floor
surface, since the surface may be moving due to water conditions.

**Cross Slope**\
The cross slopes of gangways, transition plates and floating piers that
are part of an accessible route must be designed and constructed not to
exceed a maximum of 2 percent. Measurements, absent live loads, are to
be made from a static condition (i.e., absence of movement that results
from wind, waves, etc.). Where floating piers are grounded out due to
low water conditions, slope requirements would not apply.

**Elevators and Platform Lifts**\
In addition to regular elevators, limited use/limited application
elevators or platform lifts that comply with ADAAG may be used instead
of gangways as part of an accessible route connecting floating piers and
platforms used for fishing.

Where railings, guards, or handrails are provided on a fishing pier or
platform, they must meet ADAAG provisions.

**Height**![illustration of accessible gangway serving accessible
floating pier in a large
facility](/images/guidelines_standards/Recreation_Facilities/Recreation_Facilities/fishing-guide/page-9_hi.jpg)Where
railings, guards, or handrails are provided on a fishing pier or
platform, at least 25 percent of the rails must be 34 inches or less in
height above the ground or deck so a person using a wheelchair or other
mobility device has the opportunity to fish. However,guardrails may be
higher than 34 inches if the higher portion meets all the requirements
of the International Building Code. (See [2000 International Building
Code](http://www.access-board.gov/recreation/guides/fishing.htm#2000%20International%20Building%20Code),
below.) This will allow a design professional to increase the guardrail
height if a specific location needs enhanced safety measures or a local
building code applies.

**Dispersion**\
Anglers who can stand are able to fish from any part of a pier or
platform and change locations. To provide anglers with disabilities
similar opportunities, the accessible 34-inch maximum railing must be
located in a variety of places on the pier or platform to offer a
variety of locations to fish from. Different fishing locations may
provide different water depths, shade or sun, vegetation, and proximity
to the shoreline or bank.![illustration of dispersion of accessible
fishing
locations](/images/guidelines_standards/Recreation_Facilities/Recreation_Facilities/page-9_low.jpg)

**Edge Protection**\
Where railings, guards, or handrails are provided, edge protection must
be provided and extend a minimum of 2 inches above the ground or deck
surface. This protection will prevent persons using wheelchairs or other
mobility devices from slipping off the pier or platform.

![illustation of 2-inch edge protection at
pier](/images/guidelines_standards/Recreation_Facilities/Recreation_Facilities/fishing-guide/page-9_hi.jpg)

![illustration of 12-inch deck extension without edge
protection](/images/guidelines_standards/Recreation_Facilities/Recreation_Facilities/fishing-guide/page-11.jpg)

Edge protection is not required where a railing, guardrail, or handrail
is provided, if the deck surface extends a minimum of 12 inches beyond
the inside face of the railing. This design allows a person using a
wheelchair or other mobility device to pull into a clear space and move
beyond the face of the railing to view the water in different
directions. Toe clearance must be at least 30 inches wide and a minimum
of 9 inches above the ground or deck surface beyond the railing.

**Clear Floor or Ground Space**\
At least one clear floor or ground space (30 inches by 48 inches
minimum) must be provided at each location that has a railing height of
34 inches maximum. If there are no railings, at least one clear space
must be provided on a pier or platform. (See illustration above, Railing
Heights and Clear Space.)

**Turning Space**\
Piers and platforms must have at least one turning area, either a
60-inch turning space or T-shaped space, to allow a person using a
mobility device or wheelchair to make a 180-degree turn. The space may
overlap the accessible route and clear floor or ground space.

**2000 International Building Code**\
*1003.2.12.1 Height.* Guards shall form a protective barrier not less
than 42 inches (1067 mm) high, measured vertically above the leading
edge of the tread, adjacent walking surface or adjacent seatboard.

> *Exception:*For occupancies in Group R-3, and within individual
> dwelling units in occupancies in Group R-2, both as applicable in
> Section 101.2, guards whose top rail also serves as a handrail shall
> have a height not less than 34 inches (864mm) and not more than 38
> inches (965mm) measured vertically from the leading edge of the stair
> tread nosing.

*1003.2.12.2 Opening limitations.* Open guards shall have balusters or
ornamental patterns such that a 4-inch-diameter (102mm) sphere cannot
pass through any opening up to a height of 34 inches (864mm). From a
height of 34 inches (864mm) to 42 inches (1067mm) above the adjacent
walking surfaces, a sphere 8 inches (203mm) in diameter shall not pass.

> *Exception:* The triangular opening formed by the riser, tread and
> bottom rail at the open side of a stairway shall be of a maximum size
> such that a sphere of 6 inches (152mm) in diameter cannot pass through
> the opening.
>
> \[Exceptions 2 through 4 not reprinted.\]
