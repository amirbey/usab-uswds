###  Accessible Amusement Rides
*![roller

any barrier stands between you and the full rights and dignity of
citizenship, we must work to remove it, in the name of simple decency
and justice. The promise of the ADA\...has enabled people with
disabilities to enjoy much greater access to a wide range of affordable
travel, recreational opportunities and life-enriching services.\"*

> *President George W. Bush, New Freedom Initiative, February 1, 2001*

The recreation facility guidelines described in this guide focus on
newly designed or newly constructed and altered amusement rides. Other
provisions contained in ADAAG address elements commonly found at an
amusement park or theme park, such as accessible vehicle parking spaces,
exterior accessible routes, and toilet and bathing facilities. ADAAG
addresses only the built environment (structures and grounds). The
guidelines do not address operational issues. Questions regarding
operational issues should be directed to the Department of Justice,
1-800-514-0301 or 1-800-514-0383 (TTY).

An \"amusement ride\" is defined by the guidelines as a system that
moves people through a fixed course within a defined area for the
purpose of amusement. The guidelines do not apply to vehicles such as
trams or gondolas, which, while they may be enjoyable, are designed
primarily to transport people. These vehicles are addressed in the [ADA
Accessibility Guidelines for Transportation
Vehicles](http://www.access-board.gov/transit/html/vguide.htm).

#### New Rides
New rides refer to the "first use," which is the first time amusement
park patrons take a ride on a custom designed or newly manufactured
ride. If a ride is moved to another area of a park or to another park,
it is not considered new. If the ride was purchased from another entity,
"new" is the first permanent installation of the ride, whether it was
purchased "off the shelf" or modified before installation.

#### Altered Rides
Altered rides refer to changes in structural or operational
characteristics of an existing ride vehicle configuration from those
specified by the manufacturer or the original design criteria. An
existing ride is also considered an altered ride if the load or unload
area is newly designed or constructed. Thus, if an existing ride is
simply moved to another area of a park or to another park, it is not
considered altered unless the load or unload area is newly designed or
newly constructed. Routine maintenance, painting, or changing the theme
boards is not considered an alteration.

#### Exceptions
There are four types of rides that are not covered by the guidelines.
However, other ADA requirements still apply. The four types are:

-   Mobile or portable amusement rides such as those in traveling
    carnivals, State and county fairs, and festivals, do not need to
    comply. Mobile rides are available that provide wheelchair access
    and other rides could provide transfer access with minor
    modifications. 

-   Rides that are controlled or operated by the rider (such as bumper
    cars and go-carts) are not required to comply with the guidelines,
    but an accessible route to the ride and a turning space (60-inch
    diameter circle or T-shaped turning space) in the load and unload
    area must be provided. (This exception does not apply if patrons can
    merely cause the ride to make incidental movements, but otherwise
    have no control over the ride.) 

-   Rides designed for children, assisted on and off by an adult, are
    only required to provide an accessible route to the ride and a
    turning space in the load and unload area. While the occasional
    adult user may ride, the exception applies only to those rides that
    are designed for children.

-   Rides that do not have seats must only provide an accessible route
    to the load and unload areas and a turning space in the load and
    unload area.

#### Unique Attractions
There are amusement attractions that are not specifically addressed by
the guidelines, for example, "virtual reality" rides when a device does
not move on a fixed course through an area. For these attractions, the
guidelines should be applied to the extent possible. An accessible route
should be provided to connect to a reasonable number, but at least one,
of these attractions. If appropriate technical provisions exist, they
should be applied. Operators are still subject to all the other ADA
requirements, including program accessibility or barrier removal and the
obligation to provide equal opportunities.

#### Accessible Rides
Each newly constructed or newly designed amusement ride must provide at
least one wheelchair space, or at least one ride seat designed for
transfer, or a transfer device designed to transfer a person using a
wheelchair from the load and unload area to a ride seat. The choice of
which type of access that is provided for each ride is left up to the
operator or designer.

Where possible, operators are encouraged to exceed the number of
accessible ride seats so that more people with disabilities and their
families can enjoy the rides at the same time.


### Accessible Routes
Accessible routes are continuous, unobstructed paths connecting all
accessible elements and spaces of a building or facility. For each
accessible amusement ride, an accessible route is required to connect to
a wheelchair space, a ride seat designed for transfer, or a transfer
device for use with an amusement ride. The accessible route must comply
with ADAAG provisions for the location, width (minimum of 36 inches),
passing space, head room, surface, slope (maximum of 1:12 or 8.33%),
changes in level, doors, egress, and areas of rescue assistance, unless
otherwise modified by specific provisions outlined in this guide.

As previously discussed, an accessible route is also required to connect
the load and unload areas of rides that are not required to comply with
the guidelines. This includes rides that are controlled by the rider,
rides designed for children, and rides without seats.

![diagram of an accessible route to a ride that includes a platform lift
or elevator for
entry]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ada-aba/guides/amusement/page-7.jpg){width="450"
height="291"}

Any part of an accessible route with a slope greater than 1:20 (5%) is
considered a ramp, which limits the slope to 1:12 (8.33%) maximum. There
are some exceptions to the accessible route requirements when connecting
to an accessible amusement ride:

-   In the load and unload areas or on the ride, the guidelines permit
    slopes as steep as 1:8 (12.5%), if it is structurally or
    operationally infeasible to limit ramps to slopes of 1:12 (8.33%).
    In most cases, this will be limited to areas where the route leads
    directly to the ride and there are space limitations on the ride.
    This exception does not apply to the queue line.

-   Handrails are not required on accessible routes that exceed 1:20
    (5%) in the load and unload area or on the ride, if it is
    structurally or operationally infeasible to provide them.

-   Limited-use/limited-application elevators (LULA's) and platform
    lifts may be provided as part of the accessible route serving the
    load and unload area. Platform lifts must comply with ADAAG.

The guidelines do not address the motion or speed of moving turntables
and walkways as part of the accessible route because those can be
stopped or slowed. Operators should adjust the speed to accommodate
riders, where necessary.

### Signage
![photo of sign with access symbol at entrance to waiting line
area]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ada-aba/guides/amusement/access_line.jpg){width="230"
height="198"}Signage must be provided at the entrance of the queue or
waiting line for each accessible amusement ride to identify the type of
access provided on the ride (e.g., rides with wheelchair spaces or
transfer rides). If the route to the accessible load area is different
for persons with disabilities than for other riders, there must be
signage indicating the location of the accessible load area so that
riders can avoid unnecessary backtracking.


### Amusement Rides with Wheelchair Spaces
Minimum space requirements and clearances for wheelchairs are specified
where a ride provides a wheelchair space. If possible, designers and
manufacturers should incorporate more space to enhance the ease of
loading and unloading and to accommodate a greater variety of personal
mobility devices.

#### Approach
Turning space (60-inch diameter or T-shaped space) for a wheelchair must
be provided where the accessible route adjoins the ride, so that riders
can access the ride. One side of the wheelchair space must adjoin an
accessible route. The turning space may overlap the accessible route and
the required clear floor space.

#### Load and Unload Areas
The floor or ground surface in the load and unload areas must have a
slope not steeper than 1:48 and be stable, firm, and slip resistant.

Gaps![illustration of four types of allowable
gaps]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ada-aba/guides/amusement/page-9.jpg)
Where wheelchair spaces are provided on amusement rides, the floors of
rides must be coordinated with the floors of the load and unload areas
so that when the ride is at the load and unload position, the vertical
differences between the two floors are within 5/8 inch and the
horizontal gap is not more than 3 inches, under normal conditions.

However, if compliance with those measurements is not operationally or
structurally feasible, operators may use bridge plates, ramps or other
devices. They must comply with the Board's [vehicle
guidelines](/guidelines-and-standards/transportation/vehicles/about-adaag-for-transportation-vehicles)
(36 CFR 1192.83 (c).

#### Clearances
Wheelchair spaces on amusement rides must comply with the following
provisions, with three exceptions:

-   Securement devices may overlap required clearances.

-   The wheelchair spaces may be mechanically or manually repositioned,
    for example, using a turntable.

-   There is no clear headroom requirement for wheelchair spaces on a
    ride since many rides move through confined spaces. The 80-inch
    minimum vertical clearance requirement remains for circulation areas
    and accessible routes in the queue line and load and unload areas.

#### Openings, Width and Length of Wheelchair Space
Openings and the width and length of wheelchair spaces need to be
considered in relation to each other. Openings on rides that provide
wheelchair spaces must be at least 32 inches wide. This minimum width is
necessary for passage of a wheelchair or mobility device.

Wheelchair spaces must have a clear width of 30 inches minimum and a
clear length of 48 inches minimum, measured to at least 9 inches above
the floor surface. Wheelchair access can be provided onto the ride
vehicle in many ways, including, but not limited to, rear entry, side
entry, or side entry with a turntable.

#### Side Entry Openings, and Width and Length of Wheelchair Space
If the wheelchair space can only be entered from the side, the ride must
be designed to permit sufficient turning space for people using a
wheelchair or mobility device to enter and exit the ride. Designers must
consider the position of the opening in relation to the wheelchair space
and add clear space and larger openings as necessary. For example, an
opening of 32 inches, combined with a 30-by-48-inch minimum wheelchair
space, is not enough space for turning to face the front of the ride
vehicle. If there is a 42-inch opening, a wheelchair space with a clear
length of 60 inches minimum and a clear width of 36 inches minimum would
be needed.

#### Protrusions
There may be some protrusions into wheelchair spaces on rides, but not
into circulation areas, accessible routes,or load and unload areas.
Where a wheelchair space is located on a ride, nothing may protrude into
the front of the wheelchair space 9 inches from the floor. Objects may
protrude into the space a maximum of 6 inches along the front of the
space, if they are between 9 inches and 27 inches maximum above the
floor. Objects may protrude a maximum of 25 inches along the front of
the space if they are more than 27 inches above the floor surface.

![illustration of allowable protrusions into wheelchair
spaces]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ada-aba/guides/amusement/page-11.jpg)

#### Companion Seats
![illustration of wheelchair space with companion
seating]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ada-aba/guides/amusement/page-12.jpg)
Where companion seating is provided on a ride, companion seating adjacent to
wheelchair spaces is also required in some cases. A companion seat is
required if the interior of an amusement ride is more than 53 inches
wide, there is seating for more than one rider, and the wheelchair
doesn't need to be centered within the ride to maintain the center of
gravity.

If the ride has shoulder-to-shoulder seating, the companion seating must
be shoulder-to-shoulder with the adjacent wheelchair space. If
shoulder-to-shoulder companion seating is not operationally or
structurally feasible (i.e., in water rides where the rider's center of
gravity is critical) operators must comply with this provision to the
maximum extent feasible.

### Amusement Ride Seats Designed for Transfer
Where an amusement ride seat is designed for transfer,it is expected
that someone will transfer only once from a wheelchair or mobility
device to the ride seat. Amusement ride seats designed for transfer
should allow individuals to make independent transfers to and from their
wheelchairs or mobility devices. There are many different ways that
individuals transfer from their wheelchairs or mobility devices. Both
the clear space and the height of the seat are critical for a safe and
independent transfer. When greater distances are required for transfer,
consideration should be given to providing gripping surfaces, seat
paddings, and avoiding sharp or protruding objects.

![illustration of ride seat designed for
transfer]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ada-aba/guides/amusement/page-13.jpg){width="442"
height="283"}

#### Clear Floor Space
The load and unload areas adjacent to ride seats designed for transfer
must have a clear space of 30 by 48 inches minimum. Designers may decide
which location is best suited for transfer on a particular ride.Because
people transfer in different ways, providing additional space both in
front of and to the side of the ride will increase flexibility and
usability for a more diverse population.

#### Transfer Height
Ride seats designed for transfer must be between 14 and 24 inches above
the load and unload area surface. Where possible, designers are
encouraged to locate the ride seat within 17 to 19 inches above the load
and unload surface.

#### Transfer Entry
There is a large amount of variance in amusement rides and the sides of
the ride are often part of the restraint or securement system. For those
reasons, the opening provided to transfer from a wheelchair or mobility
device must provide sufficient clearance for transfer.


### Transfer Devices for Use with an Amusement Ride
![illustration of transfer devices including portable tier, fixed tier,
and portable
bench]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ada-aba/guides/amusement/page-14.jpg){width="217"
height="502"}

Transfer devices may also be used to provide access onto an amusement
ride. A transfer device can be either permanent or temporary and does
not require modification to the ride. There are a variety of transfer
devices available that could be adapted to provide access onto an
amusement ride. Examples of devices that may provide for transfers
include, but are not limited to, transfer systems, lifts, mechanized
seats, and other custom designed systems.

Operators and designers have flexibility in developing systems that will
facilitate individuals to transfer onto amusement rides. These systems
or devices should be designed to be reliable and sturdy. A transfer
board, provided by the operator, for example, may not be sufficient
because it will not provide enough support or stability. However, people
using mobility aids may prefer to use their own transfer boards in
addition to devices provided by the operator.

Designs that limit the number of transfers required from one's
wheelchair or mobility device to the ride seat are encouraged. When
using a transfer device to access an amusement ride, the least amount of
transfers for the least amount of distance is desired.

#### Clear Floor Space
The load and unload areas adjacent to transfer devices must have a clear
space of 30 by 48 inches minimum. Designers may decide which location is
best suited for transfer on a particular ride. Because people transfer
in different ways, providing additional space both in front of and to
side of the ride will increase flexibility and usability for a more
diverse population.

#### Transfer Height
The height of the transfer device must be between 14 and 24 inches above
the load and unload area surface. Where possible, designers are
encouraged to locate the transfer device seat within 17 to 19 inches
above the load and unload surface. If greater distances are required for
transfers, extra consideration should be given to providing gripping
surfaces, seat paddings, and avoiding sharp or protruding objects in the
path of transfer to better facilitate the transfer process. If multiple
transfers are necessary to reach the amusement ride seat, it is
recommended that each vertical transfer not exceed 8 inches.

#### Wheelchair Storage Space
People using wheelchairs and mobility devices need to leave their
equipment when they transfer onto rides. There must be space in or
adjacent to load and unload areas for each ride seat designed for
transfer or transfer device. The space must be a minimum of 30 inches by
48 inches. For safety reasons, this space may not overlap any required
means of egress or an accessible route. Most designs for load and unload
areas will already include enough space. Operators are not required to
provide a constructed element or lockers for storage, only a clear
space.
