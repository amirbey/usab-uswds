![minature golf
course](/images/guidelines_standards/Recreation_Facilities/Recreation_Facilities/mingolf-guide/mingolf.jpg)*\"Whenever
any barrier stands between you and the full rights and dignity of
citizenship, we must work to remove it, in the name of simple decency
and justice. The promise of the ADA\...has enabled people with
disabilities to enjoy much greater access to a wide range of affordable
travel, recreational opportunities and life-enriching services.\"*

> *President George W. Bush, New Freedom Initiative, February 1, 2001*

The recreation facility guidelines described in this guide focus on
newly designed or newly constructed and altered miniature golf courses,
adventure-style courses, and other putting courses. Other provisions
contained in ADAAG address elements commonly found at a miniature golf
course facility, such as accessible vehicle parking spaces, exterior
accessible routes, and toilet and bathing facilities. ADAAG addresses
only the built environment (structures and grounds). The guidelines do
not address operational issues. Questions regarding operational issues
should be directed to the Department of Justice, 1-800-514-0301 or
1-800-514-0383 (TTY).

**Accessible Holes**\
At least 50 percent of the holes on a miniature golf course must be
accessible---if possible, operators should make all holes accessible.
Accessible holes must be consecutive, to offer a more socially
integrated experience. If only the minimum number of holes are
accessible, it is recommended that designers select holes that will
offer golfers who use wheelchairs or other mobility devices a playing
experience that is as equivalent as possible to the experience of
golfers without disabilities. An exception permits courses to have one
break in the sequence of accessible holes, if the last hole in the
sequence is the last hole on the course. The route in which a golfer
with a disability must travel may not require travel back through any
holes, even if the route is adjacent to the hole and not on the hole
itself.

Accessible routes are continuous, unobstructed paths connecting all
accessible elements and spaces of a building or facility. The accessible
route must comply with ADAAG provisions for the location, width (minimum
of 36 inches), passing space, head room, surface, slope (maximum of 1:12
or 8.33%), changes in level, doors, egress, and areas of rescue
assistance, unless otherwise modified by specific provisions outlined in
this guide. The accessible route must connect the facility's entrance
with the first accessible hole and with start of play area on each
following accessible hole. The course must be configured to allow an
easy exit from the last accessible hole to the facility exit or
entrance. When not all holes are accessible, a player cannot be required
to double back through holes to exit. Where possible, designers and
operators are encouraged to make all holes accessible. An accessible
route connecting accessible holes may be on the hole-playing surface or
adjacent to it.

**Accessible Routes on the Playing Surface**\
The surface of the accessible route must be stable, firm and slip
resistant. (Where carpets are used on the playing surface, they are not
required to comply with the requirements in ADAAG for accessible
carpets; however, they are still required to be stable, firm, and slip
resistant.)

surface](/images/guidelines_standards/Recreation_Facilities/Recreation_Facilities/mingolf-guide/page-7lo.jpg){width="241"
height="225"}

There is usually a curb around a hole to keep the ball within the area.
When the accessible route is provided on the course, a 1-inch high
maximum curb is permitted for an opening of 32 inches minimum where the
accessible route extends outside the hole. This opening will permit
passage of wheelchairs, while containing the ball within the hole.
Designers should consider locating this opening in an area where the
ball is not likely to roll.

The accessible route on a playing surface must be within 36 inches (the
golf club reach range) of any area where the ball comes to rest.

![illustration of accessible route on the playing
surface](/images/guidelines_standards/Recreation_Facilities/Recreation_Facilities/mingolf-guide/page-8hi.jpg){width="220"
height="224"}Landings must be 48 inches long. Where ramps change
direction, the landing size must be a minimum of 48 inches by 60 inches.
The orientation of the length and the width have not been specified for
added flexibility in design. Slopes on landings must be no more than
1:20 (5%).

If the accessible route is on the playing surface, handrails are not
required. The accessible route may include a maximum slope of 1:4 (25%)
for a maximum 4-inch rise. These steeper slopes or ramps are permitted
for limited distances.

**Accessible Routes Adjacent to the Playing Surface**![illustration of
accessible route adjacent to playing
surface](/images/guidelines_standards/Recreation_Facilities/Recreation_Facilities/mingolf-guide/page-8lo.jpg){width="220"
height="233"}[\
If the accessible route is adjacent to the playing surface, it must not
exceed 36 inches from any area where golf balls rest. This allows
players to be close enough to reach the ball and play from outside the
hole. The accessible route should be as close to the level playing areas
as possible.]{.chead}

The accessible route adjacent to the playing surface must comply with
ADAAG. The accessible route provisions in ADAAG address slope (maximum
of 1:12 or 8.33%), width (minimum of 36 inches), cross slope (maximum of
1:50 or 2%), handrails, and changes in level.

The clear floor or ground space area at the start of play for each
accessible hole must be 48 by 60 inches minimum to allow players to
position themselves for the first shot. It must have a slope no steeper
than 1:48 so that people using wheelchairs or mobility devices do not
have to hit the ball while positioned on a sloped surface. The
accessible route and the clear space can overlap.

\* The guide uses the term ADAAG (Americans with Disabilities Act
Accessibility Guidelines) as the basis of the requirements discussed.
 The recreational provisions of these guidelines were adopted into the
2010 ADA Standards without changes, so the ADAAG section numbers
correspond to the same section numbers in the ADA Standards (as well as
the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) Accessibility Standards).\
