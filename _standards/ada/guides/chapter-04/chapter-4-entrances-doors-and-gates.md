This guide explains scoping and technical requirements for accessible
entrances, doors and gates in the [ADA
Standards](../ada-standards.html). 

### Accessible Entrances: Minimum Number 
\[[§206.4](../ada-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#206%20Accessible%20Routes)\]{: .link-section} 

At least 60% of public entrances must be accessible in new construction,
in addition to entrances directly serving tenancies, parking facilities,
pedestrian tunnels and elevated walkways. "Public entrances" include all
entrances except those that are restricted or that are used exclusively
as service entrances.

#### Public Entrances Required to be Accessible

 ![Buildings with connecting elevated walkway, separate tenancies, and
parking garage. Notes: At least 60% of public entrances in addition to
the other types of entrances required to comply. At least one entrance
serving each direct access from parking structures. At least one
entrance from each elevated walkway or pedestrian tunnel. At least one
entrance to each tenancy in a facility. Additional requirements apply to
transit facilities and to entrances for inmates and detainees in
judicial, detention, and correctional facilities.

**Components of Accessible Entrances**

**![Entrance with landing served by ramp and stairs. Notes:
Communication Systems (§230) Two-way communication systems, where
provided, must be equipped with visual and audible signals and compliant
as operable parts. Designation (§216.6) International Symbol of
Accessibility label (not required if all public entrances are
accessible). Doors and Doorways (§206.5.1) At least one compliant door
or doorway. Accessible Route (§206.3) Accessible route to entrance from
site arrival points and located in the same area as general circulation
paths. Security Barriers (§206.8) Bollards and other security barriers
cannot obstruct accessible routes. Detail - Access symbol with
directional sign and note: Directional Signs at Inaccessible Entrances
(§216.6) Signs indicating the location of the nearest accessible
entrances are required at each inaccessible public entrance. These signs
must include the International Symbol of Accessibility and note
direction. Additional content or text is not specified, but can be
helpful. It is advisable to locate signs in a manner that minimizes
back-tracking.](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/images/ada-aba/guides/chapter4/4edg3.JPG){width="600"

**Entrance Landings**

Entrance landings must accommodate door maneuvering clearances as well
as landings for provided ramps.

**Entrance Landing**

 ![Entrance landing with top ramp landing and door maneuvering clearance
highlighted and shown partially overlapping. Notes: Door maneuvering
clearance can overlap ramp landing. Recommendation: Configure landings
so that maneuvering at ramps and doors does not occur near stair
openings and open drop-offs. Recommendation: Locate door swing outside
ramp landing for greater
safety.](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/images/ada-aba/guides/chapter4/4edg4.JPG){width="550"

  --- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

**Security Barriers
\[[§206.8](../ada-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#206%20Accessible%20Routes)\]**

Security bollards and screening devices at accessible entrances cannot
obstruct accessible routes or accessible means of egress. Accessible
routes can be adjacent to metal detectors and other screening devices
that do not accommodate all people with disabilities, but the route must
be located so users can maintain an equivalent level of visual contact
with personal items.

 

**Restricted Entrances
\[[§206.4.7](../ada-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#206%20Accessible%20Routes)\]**

If entrances are restricted to certain occupants on a controlled basis,
at least one must comply in addition to public entrances required to be
accessible. This applies to those entrances where entry access is
verified by security personnel and is strictly limited to certain
occupants, but no one else, including guests or companions of authorized
individuals. All other types of entrances, excluding service entrances,
are considered "public entrances" under the Standards, including
employee-only entrances requiring keys or access cards or codes but that
lack the level of security of restricted entrances.

| ments-and-features.html#708%20Two-Way%20Communication%20Systems)\]**\ |
| Where two-way communication systems are provided to gain entry to a   |
| facility or to restricted spaces, they must include visual and        |
| audible signals to accommodate people with hearing, speech, or visual |
| impairments. This applies to all entrances equipped with such         |
| systems, including those that are inaccessible. Lighted signals       |
| should have labels to indicate their meaning. If handsets are         |
| provided, cords must be at least 29" long. Control buttons and other  |
| operable parts must comply at those systems located at accessible     |
| entrances.                                                            |

**Alterations
\[**[§206.4](../ada-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#206%20Accessible%20Routes)** and
[](../ada-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#202%20Existing%20Buildings%20and%20Facilities)[§202.4](../ada-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#202%20Existing%20Buildings%20and%20Facilities)\]** 

In alterations to existing facilities, accessible entrances are
required:

-   if an existing entrance is altered (and no fully compliant entrance
    already exists);
-   when entrances are newly added to a facility or as part of a
    facility addition; or
-   as necessary to achieve an accessible path of travel to primary
    function areas that are altered (unless disproportionate to the
    cost).

When alterations are made to primary function areas, a connecting
accessible path of travel from site arrival points is required to the
extent that it does not exceed more than 20% of the project cost.
Achieving an accessible entrance should be the top priority in providing
the accessible path of travel according to regulations implementing
these Standards.

| height="112"}Qualified Historic Facilities**\                         |
| These requirements also apply when alterations are made to qualified  |
| historic facilities. However, if making a public entrance accessible  |
| would threaten or destroy a facility's historic significance (as      |
| determined by the appropriate State Historic Preservation Official or |
| Advisory Council on Historic Preservation), access can be provided to |
| a non-public entrance instead. A notification or remote monitoring    |
| system is required where such an entrance is locked. (§206.4, Ex. 2)  |

### Doors, Doorways and Gates \[[§206.5](../ada-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#206%20Accessible%20Routes) and [§404](../ada-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#404%20Doors,%20Doorways,%20and%20Gates)\]

Compliance is required for doors, doorways, and gates providing user
passage on accessible routes. At least one accessible door, doorway, or
gate serving each accessible room, space, and entrance must comply.

**Manual Doors and Gates \[§404.2\]**

**Maneuvering Clearances
\[[§404.2.4](../ada-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#404%20Doors,%20Doorways,%20and%20Gates)\]**

Required maneuvering clearances provide space for opening and proceeding
through doors, doorways, and gates using wheelchairs and other mobility
aids.

**Recessed Doors and Gates
\[[§404.2.4.3](../ada-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#404%20Doors,%20Doorways,%20and%20Gates)\]**

![Door maneuvering clearance 8" max. from face of the door. Note: The

height="277"}

Thick walls, casework, shelving, columns and other elements can cause
doors or gates to be recessed. If any obstruction within 18" of the
latch side projects more than 8" from the face of a door or gate,
maneuvering clearances for a forward approach must be provided. This
space must be inset at obstructions so that it is no more than 8" from
the face of the door or gate.

 ![Door in shallow recess with maneuvering clearance 8" max from face of

construction. The edge must be beveled 1:2 maximum above a height of
1/4". A maximum height of 3/4" is permitted for existing or altered
thresholds if they have a beveled edge on each side with a slope not
steeper than 1:2. These requirements apply to all types of doors
required to comply, including sliding doors.

 

 

**Threshold Profile**

**![Threshold ¼" high max. with vertical sides. Treshold ½" high max
(3/4" max for existing/ altered thresholds) with vertical edge up to ¼"

**Doors and Gates in Series
\[[§404.2.6](../ada-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#404%20Doors,%20Doorways,%20and%20Gates)\]**

At hinged or pivoted doors or gates in series, a separation is required
that is at least 48" plus the width of doors or gates swinging into the
space. This allows users to clear one door or gate before opening the
next and applies to those doors or gates that are opposite each other
where travel through both doors is required.

**Door and Gate Hardware
\[[§404.2.7](../ada-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#404%20Doors,%20Doorways,%20and%20Gates)\]**

fist](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/images/ada-aba/guides/chapter4/4edg22.jpg){width="220"
height="187"}Door and gate hardware must:

-   allow one-hand operation
-   not require tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist
-   operate with 5 lbf maximum
-   be located 34" to 48" above the floor or ground.

Hardware that can be operated with a loose grip or closed fist, such as
lever-shaped handles and U-shaped pulls, accommodates the greatest range
of users. (Closed-fist operation, while advisable, is not mandated by
the Standards). Round door knobs do not comply because they require
twisting of the wrist.

Latches and locks with small parts that must be manipulated can be
difficult to use and will not comply if pinching is necessary. However,
keys and access cards that are not part of the lockset are not required
to comply (but those that do not require pinching or turning provide
better access). Hardware that does not require simultaneous actions are
better, but some types, such as handles with thumb latches are
acceptable.

\
**Opening Force
\[[§404.2.9](../ada-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#404%20Doors,%20Doorways,%20and%20Gates)\]**

The maximum 5 lbf opening force applies to all accessible doors and
gates except:

-   fire doors (minimum opening force allowed by code)
-   exterior hinged doors (no maximum specified)
-   latch bolts and other devices that keep doors or gates closed

The 5 lbf maximum applies to the continuous application of force
necessary to fully open a door, not the initial force needed to overcome
the door's seal resulting from unequal pressure. Latch bolts must be
retracted and other devices that keep doors or gates closed must be
disengaged prior to measuring the opening force. (Such devices, like
other door and gate hardware, must operate with a maximum 5 lbf force
(§404.2.7), but their operating force is not included in the measure of
door or gate opening force). Door pressure gauges and other products are
available to measure the opening force.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

|                                                                       |
| When using door gauges and other measuring devices, it is advisable   |
| to follow these steps (except where product instructions specify      |
| otherwise):                                                           |

| -   Open the door so that the face edge aligns with the door frame    |
|     outside edge                                                      |
| -   Place gauge immediately above door operating hardware about 2½"   |
|     from the latch edge of the door (approximately the centerline of  |
|     the door hardware)                                                |
| -   Push slowly keeping the pressure gauge perpendicular to the face  |
|     of the door                                                       |
| -   Remove the pressure gauge when the door is open 70 degrees.       |

height="228"}Opening Force of Exterior Doors**

The opening force of exterior swing doors is impacted by wind loading
and other exterior conditions, gasketing, HVAC systems, energy
efficiency, and the weight of doors. The minimum force needed to ensure
proper closure and positive latch usually exceeds the accessible limit
of 5 pounds of force (lbf) required at other doors. For this reason, a
maximum opening force is not specified for exterior hinged doors.

**Door and Gate Surfaces
\[[§404.2.10](../ada-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#404%20Doors,%20Doorways,%20and%20Gates)\]**

![Detail of wheelchair user's feet and footrests at open door with
kickplate](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/images/ada-aba/guides/chapter4/4edg24.jpg){width="300"
height="190"}The bottom surface of doors and gates on the push side must
be smooth to a height of at least 10". This facilitates access since
mobility aids, including wheelchair footrests, are sometimes used to
push or prop open doors. Kick plates can be used to help protect door
surfaces, but any gaps or cavities between the kick plate and the door
surface must be closed or capped. Horizontal or vertical joints in this
surface cannot exceed a 1/16" variation in plane.

These requirements do not apply to:

-   Sliding doors
-   Doors and gates that do not extend to within 10" of the finish floor
    or ground
-   Existing doors or gates with kick plates (so long as cavities
    created by kick plates are capped)
-   Tempered glass doors without stiles if the top edge of the bottom
    rail or shoe is tapered at least 60⁰ from the horizontal.

\
In addition to requirements for two-way communication systems provided
at restricted entrances, the Standards include requirements for
communication access in transient lodging and residential
facilities:![hotel and residential dwelling

-   visible signals for door bells or knocks are required in transient
    lodging guest rooms providing communication access (§806.3.2);
-   a hard-wired doorbell with visible signals is required at the
    primary entrance in dwelling units providing communication access,
    along with a means to visually identify visitors without opening the
    door, such as a vision panel or peephole (§809.5.5).

### **Automatic and Power-Assisted Doors and Gates** \[[§404.3](../ada-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#404%20Doors,%20Doorways,%20and%20Gates)\]![Label: "Automatic Door -- Caution"](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/images/ada-aba/guides/chapter4/4edg29.jpg){width="150" height="148"}

Doors are not required to be automated, but must comply when provided.
The Standards apply industry Standards developed under protocols of the
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and published by the
Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association (BHMA). The ANSI/BHMA
Standards address operating characteristics, including opening speed,
safety features, sensors and activation devices, and labeling, among
others. Doors are classified by their type or level of automation.

**Power-Assisted Doors and Gates
\[[§404.3](../ada-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#404%20Doors,%20Doorways,%20and%20Gates)\]**

Power-assisted devices reduce the opening force of doors with closing
mechanisms.\
They are activated by initial manual force, switches, or sensors. Most
reduce, but do not fully eliminate, the manual force needed to open a
door. For this reason, they must meet maneuvering clearance
requirements.

**Low Energy Doors and Gates \[§404.3\]**

Low energy doors and gates usually require activation by the user
through a push plate or control and are often used in moderate traffic
locations as an alternative to manual operation. Most function like a
manual type but with a powered opener and closer option.

**Controls
\[[§404.3.5](../ada-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#404%20Doors,%20Doorways,%20and%20Gates)\]**

Door and gate controls must be compliant as operable parts (operable
with one hand and without tight grasping, pinching, twisting of the
wrist, or more than 5 lbf). Clear floor space at controls must be
located outside the door swing to prevent users from getting hit by the
door.

**Full-Powered Automatic Doors and Gates
\[[§404.3](../ada-standards/chapter-4-accessible-routes.html#404%20Doors,%20Doorways,%20and%20Gates)\]**

Full-powered automatic doors and gates are often found in grocery and
retail stores, hotels, and airports to ease passage with shopping carts
or luggage. Most are automatically activated by mats or overhead sensors
and do not require manual activation by users.

### ![question mark](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/images/ada-aba/guides/ques.jpg){width="100" height="100"}

### Common Questions

 

*Must a primary entrance be accessible?*

The Standards require that primary entrances to dwelling units be
accessible. It is advisable, though not required, that access be
provided to the primary entrances of other types of facilities.

*Is there a maximum travel distance to entrances from parking and other
site arrival points?*

No, the Standards do not limit the travel distance to accessible
entrances. Accessible parking spaces must be located on the shortest
accessible route to an accessible entrance (relative to other spaces in
the parking facility). A quantitative travel distance between entrances
and site arrival points is not specified. In addition, accessible routes
must coincide with, or be located in the same area as, general
circulation paths.

*Is automation of doors required?*

Automation of doors is not required by the Standards, but it is highly
recommended for entrance doors where the opening force is significant. A
maximum opening force is not specified for exterior hinged doors because
of the closing force typically necessary for ensuring positive latch
against wind loading, air pressure, and other conditions. This often
results in opening forces well above the 5 lbf maximum. Difficulty
opening exterior swing doors is a common complaint. Automation offers
the best solution. Otherwise, closers should be set with the minimum
force practicable.

*Do requirements for "public entrances" apply only to those entrances
used by the public?*

No, scoping provisions for accessible public entrances are not limited
to those used by the public. The term "public entrance" applies to all
entrances other than service or restricted entrances. "Restricted
entrances" are those available for common use (but not public use) on a
controlled basis. This is intended to apply specifically to entrances
where user identity is verified and entry is strictly limited to certain
occupants, but no one else, including guests or companions of authorized
individuals. Other types of entrances with lower levels of security,
including employee-only entrances requiring keys, keypads, or access
cards, are considered "public entrances."

*Are employee entrances required to be accessible?*

Where employee entrances meeting the definition of a "restricted
entrance" are provided, at least one must be accessible. Other types of
employee entrances must be accessible as "public entrances." In
facilities with separate visitor and employee entrances, access should
be dispersed so that accessible entrances serve both types of traffic.

*Are closet doors and pantry doors required to comply?*

Requirements for doors, doorways, and gates in §404 apply to those that
provide "user passage" (§206.5). Doors serving walk-in closets or
pantries must comply. Doors to shallow closets or pantries, cabinets and
other storage elements not providing user passage do not have to comply
with provisions for doors, but must meet requirements for storage
(§811), including those for clear floor space and operable parts.

*Is compliance on both sides of a door or gate required when it is
usable only from one side?*

No, compliance is not required on both sides of those doors or gates
that can be used in one direction only. Compliance is required only on
the usable side. Examples include exit-only doors with no operating
hardware on the exterior side or separate enter and exit fare gates in
transit stations. However, if a door or gate is usable in both
directions, even occasionally, such as exit-only doors that may
automatically unlock in emergencies to be usable from both directions,
then compliance on both sides is required.

*Can handrails or other elements overlap door maneuvering clearances?*

No, door maneuvering clearances must be free of any overlapping objects,
even those providing knee and toe clearance, which can interfere with
maneuvering at doors and doorways. However, door maneuvering clearances
can be offset up to 8" from the face of the door or gate to accommodate
wall thickness, casework, shelves, or other elements adjacent to
doorways, including handrails. The door maneuvering clearance must be
measured from the leading edge of such elements so that the full
clearance is free of any obstruction.

Is latch-side maneuvering clearance as specified in the Standards
applicable to doors with panic bars?

When latch-side clearance is required as part of the maneuvering
clearances specified for a door, including on the push side of doors
with a forward approach that have both a closer and latch, it must be
provided at manual doors with panic bars as well. Latch-side clearance
not only provides proper positioning at door hardware but also
facilitates proceeding through doors against the force of closers.

*Are locks operated by keys prohibited due to the pinching or twisting
of the wrist their operation typically requires?*

No, non-fixed portions of door or gate hardware, including keys and
access cards, are not covered by the Standards, but those that can be
used without pinching or turning will provide easier access. Non-fixed
portions can be modified or adapted as needed for accessibility.

*Are spring hinges and gravity hinges considered "closers" in
determining the size of maneuvering clearances?*

No. Some approaches require additional maneuvering clearances when a
door or gate is equipped with a closer because of the additional force
that must be counteracted in proceeding through doors. Since spring and
gravity hinges do not significantly impact the opening force of doors,
they are not considered "closers" for purposes of specifying door
maneuvering clearance.

*Can maneuvering for a forward approach be provided when there is space
at least 60" deep in front of a door?*

Space at least 60" deep in front of a door that is unobstructed on
approach sides will provide sufficient depth for a forward approach if
appropriate strike-side clearance is provided; but in the case of
pull-side/ hinge-side approaches, greater latch-side clearance (36"
minimum) is still required because the minimum depth for this clearance
is 60" (54" if the latch-side clearance is at least 42").

 ![Person using scooter making right angler turn at door in corridor 60"

accommodate a forward approach, except in case of hinge approaches on
the pull side.*

height="300"}   *On the pull side of hinge approaches, 36" min.
latch-side clearance is required if the depth is 60" min.  (The depth
can be 54" min. if the latch-side clearance is at least 42".) *

 

* *

*Is additional latch side clearance required on the push side of doors
with a forward approach when either a latch or closer (but not both) is
provided?*

No, latch clearance 12" minimum is required for forward approaches on
the push-side of doors equipped with both a closer and a latch. If a
door has a closer but no latch, or a latch and no closer, no additional
latch side clearance is required (although providing the clearance is
helpful in maneuvering through doors with closers without latches). This
is also true for the additional depth required for hinge approaches on
the push side when both a closer and latch is provided. For latch
approaches, additional clearance is required on the push side and the
pull side when just a closer is provided.

*Are screen doors or storm doors considered "doors in series"?*

No, screen or storm doors are not considered "doors in series" since
they are part of the same doorway opening as the entry door. They are
not prohibited by the Standards but must meet all applicable
requirements for doors except those pertaining to doors in series.

*If a more recent edition of ANSI/BHMA Standards for automated doors is
issued should that be followed instead of those referenced?*

The specific editions of the ANSI/BHMA Standards referenced by the
Standards are to be followed (although the Access Board intends to
update references to keep them current). Compliance with a later edition
may be possible under the provision for "equivalent facilitation" (§103)
if it is comparable to, or stricter than, the referenced editions.
