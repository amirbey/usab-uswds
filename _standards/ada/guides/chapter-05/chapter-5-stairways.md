This guide explains requirements in the [ADA
Standards](../ada-standards.html) for stairways. 

### []{#number}Required Compliance \[[§210](../ada-standards/chapter-2-scoping-requirements.html#210%20Stairways)\]

Interior and exterior stairs that are part of a required means of egress
must meet the Standards. Compliance is required for all stairs on
required egress routes, including those comprised of a single riser. The
Standards do not apply to stairways that are not part of a required
means of egress nor to alternating tread devices and "ship's ladders."
The Standards exempt aisle stairs in assembly areas, stairs in
non-public areas of detention and correctional facilities, and stairs of
play components.

![Building schematic showing monumental stairs between two floors and
stair towers on each end connecting all 3 floors. Notes: Stairs that are
part of a required means of egress must comply. Compliance is not
required for monumental stairs and other stairs if they are not part of
a required means of egress. Second figure shows exit door to exterior
landing with stairs. Note: Stairs that are part of exit discharge or
other components of a means of egress must comply.

**Alterations**

In alterations, stairs between levels that are connected by an
accessible route (e.g., ramp or elevator) are not required to meet the
Standards, but handrails must comply when stairs that are part of a
means of egress are altered (§210.1, Ex. 2).

###  []{#stairs}Stairways \[[§504](../ada-standards/chapter-5-general-site-and-building-elements.html#504%20Stairways)\]

Requirements for stairways address treads and risers, surfaces, nosings,
and handrails.

![Stairs with riser 4" -- 7" high and tread depth 11" min. Notes: Treads
and Risers (§504.2 and §504.3) All steps on a flight must have uniform
riser heights within a range of 4" -- 7" and uniform tread depths that
are 11" min. Open risers are prohibited. Tread Surface and Wet
Conditions (§504.4 and (§504.7) Tread surfaces must comply with
requirements for ground and floor surfaces (§302) and cannot have
changes in level other than slopes not steeper than 1:48. Treads and
landings subject to wet conditions must be designed to prevent the
accumulation of
water.](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/images/ada-aba/guides/chapter5/5s3.jpg){width="550"
height="330"}

![Three nosing profiles shown. Tread edge radius with note: The radius
of curvature at the leading edge of the tread must be ½" max. Angled
riser with note: Risers can slope under the tread at an angle not
exceeding 30º from vertical. Curved or beveled nosing with note: Nosings
cannot project more than 1½" over the tread, and the underside of the
leading edge of the nosing must be curved or beveled.

### []{#hrails}Handrails \[[§504.6](../ada-standards/chapter-5-general-site-and-building-elements.html#504%20Stairways), [§505](../ada-standards/chapter-5-general-site-and-building-elements.html#505%20Handrails)\]

Handrails are required on both sides of stairs and must be continuous
within the full length of each stair flight. Inside handrails on
switchback or dogleg stairs must be continuous.

**Stairway Handrails**

![Switchback stair and landing. Notes and labels: 12" min. horizontal
top extension in same direction as stair flight (§505.10.2); 34" - 38"
(consistent height) above nosing to top of gripping surface (§505.4),
Sloped bottom extension 1 tread depth min. beyond last riser nosing in
same direction as stair flight (§505.10.3), Handrails must return to a
wall, guard, or floor and cannot rotate within fittings (§505.10.2,
§505.10.3), Inside handrails at switchback/ dogleg turns must be
continuous (extension not required) (§505.3), Top and sides of gripping
surface cannot be obstructed; bottom can be obstructed up to 20% of the
length (§505.6), In alterations, full handrail extensions are not
required where they would project into circulation paths and pose a
hazard (§505.10, Ex.
3).](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/images/ada-aba/guides/chapter5/5s5.jpg){width="600"
height="635"}

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **![design compass](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/images/ada-aba/guides/compass.jpg){width="35" height="63"}*Recommendation:*  In facilities that primarily serve children, a second set of stairway handrails 28" high maximum above stair nosings is advisable. A vertical clearance 9" minimum between upper and lower handrails will help prevent entrapment.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

**Handrail Extensions
\[[§505.10](../ada-standards/chapter-5-general-site-and-building-elements.html#505%20Handrails)\]**

Handrail extensions at the top and bottom must return to walls, guards,
or floors and horizontal portions must comply as protruding objects. The
length is measured to the start of the return radius.

* ![Top horizontal handrail extension 12" long min. at stairs. Note:
Handrails at the top of stairways must extend 12" minimum horizontally
above the landing beginning directly above the first riser nosing or be
continuous to the handrail of an adjacent stair flight (§505.10.2).

* ![Bottom handrail extension sloping beyond the last riser nosing for a
distance at least equal to one tread depth. Note: Handrails at the
bottom must extend beyond the last riser nosing at the slope of the
stair flight for a distance at least equal to one tread depth or be
continuous to the handrail of an adjacent stair flight protruding
objects.

![Top horizontal handrail extension with P-shaped return to post; bottom
edge of return is 27" high max. Notes: treatment as protruding object
not required. Objects mounted on posts with leading edges higher than
27" cannot protrude into circulation paths more than 12" (§307.3). With
handrails, this applies only to horizontal portions, not sloped
portions. Horizontal top extensions that return to posts can protrude
any amount if the leading edge is 27" max. above the finish floor or
ground. Recommendation: Treat free-standing bottom extensions as
protruding objects if they have leading edges higher than
27".](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/images/ada-aba/guides/chapter5/5s8a.jpg){width="524"

**Handrail Clearance and Cross Section
\[[§505.5](../ada-standards/chapter-5-general-site-and-building-elements.html#505%20Handrails),
[§505.7](../ada-standards/chapter-5-general-site-and-building-elements.html#505%20Handrails)\]**

Surface requirements and clearances facilitate a power grip along the
length of handrails. Handrails can have circular or non-circular
cross-sections, but must have rounded edges. The gripping surface and
adjacent surfaces must be free of abrasive or sharp elements.
Wall-mounted handrails with leading edges higher than 27" cannot
protrude more than 4½" into circulation paths (§307.2).

**Circular Cross Section and Clearance**

**![Handrail circular cross section 1/1/4" to 2" in diameter with a 1 ½"
clearance behind and below. Note: Specifications for handrails also
address the diameter of circular cross sections and required knuckle
clearance.](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/images/ada-aba/guides/chapter4/4ar29.jpg){width="500"
height="287"} **

**Non-Circular Cross Section and Clearance**

![Handrail non-circular cross section (square with rounded corners) with
2 ¼" max. dimension, rounded edges, 4" to 6 ¼" perimeter dimension, 1 ½"
clearance behind, and clearance below that is 1 ½" (less 1/8" for each
½" additional perimeter dimension. Note: Non-circular cross sections
must have rounded edges and meet perimeter and cross-section dimensions.
Other profiles meeting these criteria are
permitted.](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/images/ada-aba/guides/chapter4/4ar30.jpg){width="500"

**Escalators **

![Escalator
symbol](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/images/ada-aba/guides/chapter5/5s9.jpg){width="100"
height="78"}The ADA Standards address escalators in rail and fixed
guideway stations (§810.9) but not those provided in other types of
facilities. Escalators must have a clear width of at least 32" and meet
specific provisions in the ASME A17.1 Safety Code for Elevators and
Escalators. The referenced ASME criteria require steps to be demarcated
by yellow lines 2" wide maximum along the back and sides (§6.1.3.5.6)
and specify at least 2, but no more than 4, flat steps at escalator
entrances and exits (§6.1.3.6.5).

###  []{#cq}Common Questions {#common-questions style="text-align: left;"}

 

*Are stairs that are not part of means of egress required to comply with
the Standards?*

No, interior or exterior stairs that are not part of a required means of
egress do not have to meet the Standards.

*Are exterior stairs required to comply with the Standards?*

The Standards apply to both exterior and interior stairs that are part
of a required means of egress. This includes exterior stairs that are
part of exit discharge (i.e., the path from an exit to a public way such
as a street or alley).

*Is there a minimum number of risers a stairway must have for it to be
covered?*

No, the Standards apply to any stairs that are part of a means of egress
regardless of the number of risers.

*Are stairs in residential dwelling units covered by the Standards
required to comply?*

Yes, stairs that are part of a means of egress must comply in mobility
accessible residential dwelling units covered by the Standards. Egress
stairs of residential facilities that are located outside individual
dwelling units also must comply.

*Can stair treads and risers be perforated?*

Stair treads must meet requirements for floor or ground surfaces which
specify that surface openings not allow passage of a sphere more than ½
inch in diameter (§302.3). Risers cannot be open, but perforations or
openings in riser surfaces that prohibit passage of a sphere not more
than ½ inch in diameter are acceptable.

*Can handrail extensions wrap or turn?*

Handrail extensions must be in the same direction as the stair flight,
but continuous handrails can wrap at the inside turn of switchback or
dogleg stairways. In alterations where the required extension would
project into circulation paths and pose a hazard, they can turn, wrap,
or be shortened as necessary.

*![Handrail extension shown at latch side of door and shown outside door
maneuvering clearance that is located 8" max. from the face of the
door.](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/images/ada-aba/guides/chapter5/5s10.jpg){width="240"
height="226"}Can handrails overlap door maneuvering clearances?*

No, door maneuvering clearances must be free of any overlapping objects,
even those providing knee and toe clearance, which can interfere with
maneuvering at doors and doorways. However, door maneuvering clearances
can be offset up to 8" from the face of the door or gate to accommodate
wall thickness, casework, shelves, or other elements adjacent to
doorways, including handrails. The door maneuvering clearance must be
measured from the leading edge of such elements so that the full
clearance is free of any obstruction.

*Can handrails be attached to guard rails?*

Yes, handrails can be installed on guard rails if all applicable
requirements are met.

*Is a center handrail required at wide stairways?*

No, a center handrail at stairs is not required by the Standards. If a
center handrail is provided, compliance with the handrail
specifications, while advisable, is not required.

*Is color contrast required for stair nosings?*

Visual contrast on stair nosings or the leading edges of treads is
helpful for people with low vision, but it is not required by the
Standards except at escalators in rail and fixed guideway stations which
must meet the ASME A17.1 Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators. The
ASME A17.1 code requires escalator steps to be demarcated by yellow
lines 2" wide maximum along the back and sides.

*Can guards or collars be attached to handrails to prevent skateboard
traffic?*

No, handrail gripping surfaces at egress stairs subject to the Standards
must be unobstructed on the top and sides and free of sharp or abrasive
elements so that users can maintain a continuous grip along the full
length (§505.6 and §505.8).
